                        <p>I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. After completing middle school, I received a full scholarship to attend Darlington School in Rome, GA as a boarding student. 
                            There, I wanted to challenge myself in every subject. During my time at Darlington, I developed a love for history. 
                            In 2018, I graduated and enrolled at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill as an in-state student. In my first year at UNC, I took an introductory computer science course in 
                            order to fulfill a general education requirement without having any experience. I quickly discovered that I had made a mistake by not acquainting myself with programming sooner, 
                            and I fell in love with the subject. Eventually, I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in History.</p>
